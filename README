Description:
-------------- 

    This program resembles  a mathematical vector class, that preforms the following operations:
1- Addition of two or more vectors of  same dimensions – if index doesn't match, it throw an error  .
2- Subtraction of two or more vectors.
3- Multiplication of two or more vectors.
4-Assigning operation between two vectors, after adjusting the target vector index to the (rhs).
5- Adding and assigning to a vector.
6- It uses template, thus is valid for several types of data.

Running Instruction:
-------------------------
A) If you use the included test file: 
1-type   make : will run the makefile which will create executables for the included files after compiling any updated files, it will create two object files in the same directory.
2-type   ./ run   : to run the program.

B)If you are using a different test file:
1-you will need to include both of “ VecXd.h” and “VecXd.cpp” to your test file.
2-modify the makefile accordingly 

Future Developments: will include,  / ,%, operations.
------------------------

Known Bugs:  None. Runs correctly on the attached test file, and has been test successfully with other test files
---------------  

Knowing Issues: Users should press “enter” after each entry to avoid passing too many arguments, the excess inputs may be copied from the buffer stream into to next entry and cause errors.
